# Background and Motivation:
Facial emotions are important factors in human communication that help us understand the intentions of others. In general, people infer the emotional states of other people, such as joy, sadness, and anger, using facial expressions and vocal tone. Facial expressions are one of the main information channels in interpersonal communication. Therefore, it is natural that research of facial emotion has been gaining lot of attention over the past decades with applications not only in the perceptual and cognitive sciences, but also in affective computing and computer animations. Data Analytics has become very popular , where data is examined and meaningful insights are derived. People deal with different emotions each day and every minute of their life. These emotions could be a result of their responsibilities , relationships or any hardships they come across.
Emotions play a large role in heart rate response. Anger, fear, and anxiety cause a rapid heart rate, while depression usually results in lowering of heart rate. Feelings of love, compassion, happiness usually result in slow heart action. Emotional stress causes heart rate to stay elevated.
We would like to detect and study the emotions and heart rate based on those emotions we experience say per day, consolidating it for a month, by visualizing the rate at which it changes. We can find critical insights from our visualizations, hence taking corrective measures towards emotions we want to improve upon.

# Objective:
The core idea of our project is to detect a person’s emotion using their facial expression and heart rate using their wearable fitness device, to gain useful insights on how their emotion and heart rate varies when they experience a certain emotion.
